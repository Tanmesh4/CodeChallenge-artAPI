# Info
❯ ArtAPI is a museum that wants to launch an online catalogue of their collection. They have a backend team, who developed an API and a design team that delivered a Figma file.

❯ Responsiveness and component reusability are a must in every project.

❯ It’s up to you to deliver the final working application.

# Goal
❯ The objective of this challenge is to test your frontend development skills.

❯ Various problem-solving paths are possible to solve this challenge.

❯ The main goal is to evaluate your ability to handle the challenge and, with the provided information, structure a project and implement a solution.

# My Task
## Basic delivery:
❯ Working responsive application. Note: the team didn’t create a mobile and tablet version, but you should implement those. To make your job easier, you should create fluid components.

❯ Pixel-perfect code representing the delivered layout.

❯ README.md with instructions to run the project.

## Extras:
❯ The designer didn’t deliver animations, transitions, etc., but you know that’s a

❯ Implement some other feature you think could add value to the project.
